# Javascript-in-the-browser---Forms
Project in Vefsk√≥linn


Project for studying Javascript Forms.

For this project i followed along with a tutorial that i thought was interesting. The project is in codepen and is a follow along tutorial by Brad Traversy, i used the tutorial guidance and played around with the code, i really like the wave function when the name, email and password are clicked, added comments and learned some new tricks in Javascript.
